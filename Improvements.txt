improvements:

Modularization:
Current State: The code is placed within a single endpoint handler, which makes it less modular.
Improvement: Consider modularizing the code into separate functions or modules, each responsible for a specific task (e.g., authentication, Gmail API operations, auto-reply logic).

Error Handling:
Current State: The error handling is basic and catches any error during the entire process.
Improvement: Implement more granular error handling, distinguishing between different types of errors (authentication errors, API operation errors, etc.). Provide more informative error messages.

Code Comments:
Current State: The code includes comments, but some parts could benefit from more detailed explanations.
Improvement: Add comments to explain complex logic, especially within functions. Consider adding JSDoc comments to describe function parameters and return values.

Magic Values:
Current State: Some values, such as the label name "Vacation Auto-Reply" and the interval range (45 to 120 seconds), are hard-coded.
Improvement: Consider moving magic values to constants at the beginning of the file to improve maintainability and make it easier to adjust these values.
